Example for room reservation in Main Menu

---> Think about the task in normal human terms. <--- 

"Find and Reserve a Room"

Return valid  Check In date
Return valid  Check Out date

Return availiable rooms for that range

Main Menu logic: no rooms-> go 7 days in future and try again.

Return valid Check In Date incremented by number of days
Return valid Check Out Date incremented by number of days

Return available rooms for that range

Could this input comming from the user be forming its own object? 
A pendingReservation object? 

After being given the input dates, it could populate the two lists.

I can then return an object to the Main menu. pendingReserve.firstDates, pendingReserve.laterDates.
